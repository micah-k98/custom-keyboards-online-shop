The project exists and is perfect for people who just started getting into custom keyboards and trying to build their own; or if they just want an already made customized keyboard to style their office desks as it creates a motivational atmosphere for the user.

It also caters to enthusiasts and would like to add more keyboards to their collections.


## Interesting Piece of this Project

[Shopping Cart](#shopping-cart-page) is an interesting piece because of how the product list has photos in it and it also includes the status whether the item is in-stock or if there are a few items left.
